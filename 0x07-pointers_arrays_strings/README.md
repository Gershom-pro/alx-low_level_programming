0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings


In this lesson, we studied concepts such as:
1. C - Pointer to Pointer
2. Multi-dimensional Arrays in C
3. Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming


We answered questions like;
1. What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
2. What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
3. What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

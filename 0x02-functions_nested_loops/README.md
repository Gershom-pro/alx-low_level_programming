0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, we are expected to learn and understand nested loops, header files, and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and definingfunctions.

TASKS:

0. _putchar

0-putchar.c: C program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. Returns 0.

1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

1-alphabet.c: prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. use _putchar twice in your code

2. 10 x alphabet

2-print_alphabet_x10.c: prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3. islower

3-islower.c: C program that checks for lowercase character. Returns 1 if c is lowercase

Returns 0 otherwise

4. isalpha

4-isalpha.c:  function that checks for alphabetic character. Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase. Returns 0 otherwise.

5. Sign

5-sign.c: function that prints the sign of a number.
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you

6-abs.c: function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

7-print_last_digit.c: function that prints the last digit of a number.
Returns the value of the last digit

8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

8-24_hours.c: function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

9. Learn your times table

9-times_table.c: function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

10. a + b

10-add.c: function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. 98 Battery Street, the OG

11-print_to_98.c: function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in order
The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
The last printed number should be 98
No usage of the standard library

12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself

100-times_table.c:function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything

13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women

101-natural.c: program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

Not allowed to use the standard library


14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A.

102-fibonacci.c: program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line

The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space , 
Not allowed to use the standard library


15. Even Liber Abbaci

103-fibonacci.c: program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of a Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000; followed by a new line.


16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+

104-fibonacci.c: program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
Not allowed to use the standard library
not allowed to use any other library (You can’t use GMP etc…)
not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)

0x0D. C - Preprocessor


At the end of this project, I understood;

1. C program compilation process
2. Object-like Macros
3. Macro Arguments
4. Pre processor directives in C
5. The C preprocessor
6. Standard predefined macros
7. How to include guard


Concepts looked at include;

1. What macros are and how to use them
2. How to include guard to header files



Tasks for this project include the following:

0. Object-like Macro

Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.



1. Pi

Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.



2. File name

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.



3. Function-like macro

Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.



4. SUM

Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

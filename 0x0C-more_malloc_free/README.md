#0x0C. C - More malloc, free


#Concepts expected to look at in this project:

Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free.


At the end of this project, I learnt how to use the "exit", "calloc" and the "realloc" functions.


Tasks completed in this lesson include:

0. Trust no one

Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.



1. string_nconcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.



2. _calloc

Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.


3. array_range

Write a function that creates an array of integers.



4. _realloc

Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free



5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope

Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.

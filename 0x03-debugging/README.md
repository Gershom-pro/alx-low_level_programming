0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. This project has helped me to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

TASKS

The list of tasks under this project is as follows:

0. Multiple mains

Given a test file main.c, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.


1. Like, comment, subscribe

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.


2. 0 > 972?

This program prints the largest of three integers. Something is definitely not right.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.


3. Leap year

This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.

Oh no! That doesn’t seem right.Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

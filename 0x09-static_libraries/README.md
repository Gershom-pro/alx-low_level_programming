0x09. C - Static libraries


In this lesson, I learnt:

1. how to create a static C library using "ar" and "ranlib"
2. how to use a C static library in a program
3. the difference between the Dynamic and Static library


Task for this lesson include:


0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create the static library libmy.a containing function prototypes


1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
